# Executive Summary
### Game Concept

In this game, the player assumes the role of a bug that has escaped the system and is now exploring its surroundings. Unaware of the harm it is causing to the world and objects around it, the bug is being hunted down by security units sent by the system to stop it from harming the world.

### Genre

Adventure stealth game with puzzle elements.

### Target Audience

The game is targeted towards casual gamers, specifically those who enjoy puzzle games and adventure games.

### Project Scope

The game will consist of multiple levels where the player must navigate through the system while avoiding security units and solving puzzles to progress. The bug will have various abilities, such as the ability to climb walls, jump long distances, and produce effects on nearby objects that can alter their behavior, which will be used to overcome obstacles. The game will have a lighthearted and whimsical tone, with bright and colorful visuals.



# Mechanics
### Core Gameplay

The core gameplay of this game will involve a combination of stealth and puzzle-solving mechanics, both of which are essential for making progress in the game.

As the player, you will have a unique ability to apply effects on nearby enemies or objects to manipulate their behavior in order to overcome obstacles and advance through the game's challenges.

**Effect Circle**

The player's main ability is to create a circle that affects any "affectable" object within its radius. This ability has a cooldown period after each use.

The use of this ability will require gathering target information first before being able to apply effect on target.

**Puzzles**

The puzzles in the game will be designed to require the player to use their unique ability in creative ways to progress. This will involve manipulating objects and enemies to create paths and solve environmental puzzles.

**Stealth**

The player cannot engage in combat with enemies, so their only means of survival is to hide from enemies.

### Game Flow

The game will commence at the Recycle Area, and the player can subsequently explore other maps. Together, these maps will form a large maze, challenging the player to find a way out.

While exploring, the player will encounter unstable objects, regular enemies, and elite unit enemies.

Special enemies will try to catch the player and return it to the start (Recycle Area).

The player can use their unique ability by casting it on unstable objects to solve puzzles, or on enemies to bypass or hide from them.

### Player Physics

The player will be able to move in four directions in a 2D environment.

**Jump**

The player will be able to jump and/or fly for a short duration.

**Fly**

The player can extend the jump and start flying by using the Jetpack.

### Enemies Physics

**Patrollers**: Patrolling the ground, they are slow but will notify faster enemies on player detection.

**Hunter**: Fast and will destroy on sight.

**Ghost**: Underground creatures, slow.

### Story

In a futuristic world, there was a complex system that controlled everything from transportation to communication. Little did the system know, a bug had managed to infiltrate it, undetected.

The bug was curious and adventurous, exploring every nook and cranny of the system. It had no malicious intent and was simply happy to exist within the system. However, as time passed, the bug began to cause problems. Parts of the system crash and become corrupted, all without the bug knowing it was the cause.

The system began to investigate, running diagnostic tests. it couldn't put its finger on the problem, it knew that something was amiss. As the bug continued to wreak havoc, the system's fighters were deployed to eliminate the threat.

The fighters were a group of highly skilled bug hunters who specialized in identifying and eliminating bugs in the system. They created a hostile environment for the bug, hoping to force it out of hiding.

The bug, unaware that it was the target of the fighters, continued to explore the system. It was content to exist within the system, but it knew that something was wrong.
